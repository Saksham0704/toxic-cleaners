                        About Septic Tank
                    </h1>
                    <P>A septic tank consists of one or more concrete or plastic tanks of between 4,500 and 7,500 litres
                        (1,000 and 2,000 gallons); one end is connected to an inlet wastewater pipe and the other to a
                        septic drain field. Generally these pipe connections are made with a T pipe, allowing liquid to
                        enter and exit without disturbing any crust on the surface. Today, the design of the tank
                        usually
                        incorporates two chambers, each equipped with an access opening and cover, and separated by a
                        dividing wall with openings located about midway between the floor and roof of the tank.

                        Wastewater enters the first chamber of the tank, allowing solids to settle and scum to float.
                        The
                        settled solids are anaerobically digested, reducing the volume of solids. The liquid component
                        flows
                        through the dividing wall into the second chamber, where further settlement takes place. The
                        excess
                        liquid, now in a generally clear condition, then drains from the outlet into the septic drain
                        field,
                        also referred to as a leach field, drain field or seepage field, depending upon locality. A
                        percolation test is required prior to installation to ensure the porosity of the soil is
                        adequate to
                        serve as a drain field.

                        The remaining impurities are trapped and eliminated in the soil, with the excess water
                        eliminated
                        through percolation into the soil, through evaporation, and by uptake through the root system of
                        plants and eventual transpiration or entering groundwater or surface water. A piping network,
                        often
                        laid in a stone-filled trench (see weeping tile), distributes the wastewater throughout the
                        field
                        with multiple drainage holes in the network. The size of the drain field is proportional to the
                        volume of wastewater and inversely proportional to the porosity of the drainage field. The
                        entire
                        septic system can operate by gravity alone or, where topographic considerations require, with
                        inclusion of a lift pump.

                        Certain septic tank designs include siphons or other devices to increase the volume and velocity
                        of
                        outflow to the drainage field. These help to fill the drainage pipe more evenly and extend the
                        drainage field life by preventing premature clogging or bioclogging.</P>

                    </h1>
                    <P>
                        <li>Never lean over a septic tank opening or stick your head into tank to examine its interior -
                            you
                            could become overcome by gases, fall into the tank, and suffocate.</li>
                        <li> tank cleaning and repairing to be done bytrained professionals.</li>
                        <li>Never enter a septic tank unless you are specially trained and are wearing special equipment
                            and
                            gear for that purpose, including a self-contained breathing apparatus.</li>
                        <li>o not go into a septic tank to retrieve someone who has fallen in and was overcome by gases
                            unless you are equipped with a self-contained breathing apparatus. Instead, call for
                            emergency
                            services and put one or more fans at the top of the septic tank to blow in fresh air.
                            Never work alone in or around a septic tank.</li>
                        <li> Don't ignite flames or smoke cigarettes at or near the tank. This can cause an explosion.
                            Be sure that the tank and its access ports have sound and secure covers that do not risk
                            collapse and which cannot be removed or nudged aside by children or animals.</li>
                        <li>Beware of old, collapsing septic systems. Abandoned septic tanks with unsafe covers have
                            caused
                            deaths among children, adults, pets, horses, and livestock. Watch out for evidence of
                            sinking
                            soil, rusted-through steel septic tank covers, home-made wooden or flimsy tank covers, or
                            home
                            made cesspools and drywells which risk collapse.</li>
                        <li>Watch for electrical hazards when digging outdoors. Watch out that you don't dig into and
                            cut an
                            electrical wire (or other buried mechanical line such as a gas or water line). Buried
                            electrical
                            wires can look a lot like tree roots.</li>

                        Basic principle of operation
                    </h1>
                    <P> Septic tank is container with their own ecosystem of microorganisms, which take in place
                        complex biochemical processes to reduce content of polluting substances of sewage put in.
                        The microorganisms found in domestic sewage are bacteria, which use wastewater containing
                        solubilized nutrients for cell growth and energy. The growth of bacteria population is
                        dependent on the characteristics of the wastewater â€“ temperature, concentration of organic
                        matter, toxic chemicals or cleaners. The main part of septic tank is oxygen-free or
                        anaerobic. Only in the clear zone of septic tank oxygen is available. The treatment
                        processes what are going on in those parts are different.



                        The treatment efficiency of septic tank strongly depends not only on characteristics of
                        influent wastewater, but also on the size of septic tank, because optimal retention time
                        gives more viability to the process of treatment.</P>
